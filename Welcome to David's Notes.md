# Welcome!
Welcome to my little hub of notes on Obsidian!

## Wait, why am I not using Notion?
Well, I've been wanting to try Obsidian because it sounds interesting and because it's just a pure notetaker and does not need any customisation. It works and it works well. It's also really customisable and does the job at note-taking. However, bigger projects like passion projects (e.g. TreeSim) and other stuff will still stay on Notion.
