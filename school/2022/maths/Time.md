## Lesson 1

### 24-hour Time
To calculate 24h time --> 12h time:
- The 24h time queried - 12 hours

To calculate 12h time --> 24h time:
- The 12h time queried + 12 hours

### DRT (Distance = Rate * Time)
e.g.
- 12km = 16km/hour
- 12km// 10km/h = 0.75h = 45 mins

### Tip
All months have 31 days except February, March, May, August, September, and November

## Lesson 2

### Working with Time
To calculate time on a calculator:
- Type the hour, then the [°'"'] button afterwards.
  e.g. 1° 45° 11°+ 2° 31° 1° = 4° 16' 12"
  
### Time Zones

#### Definitions
**UTC** is defined as *Coordinated Universal Time (or Universal Coordinated Time)*.
**UTC** can also be defined as **GMT**, which is *Greenwich Mean Time*.

#### How to Calculate Different Times in Different Time Zones
An **example question** could be:
```
If it was 6pm in Sydney, what time is it in New York?

Sydney would be UTC+10
New York, USA would be UTC-5
Bissau would be UTC+0 (for reference)
```

1. You would reset the time queried (e.g. 6pm) back to UTC+0.
   If you subtracted the amount of hours the time zone was ahead of UTC, it will reset it back to UTC+0.
   e.g. 6pm - 10 hours = 8am (UTC+0)
   
2. Then, you add or subtract by the desired time zone, for this scenario, New York.
   e.g. 8am - 5 hours = 3am (UTC-5)

## Lesson 3 
Today, we're practicing Exercise 7C in the Cambridge Text Book. This is referred to as Page 353.

##### Answers
