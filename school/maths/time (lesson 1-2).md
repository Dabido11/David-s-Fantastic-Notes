## Lesson 1
### 24-hour Time
To calculate 24h time --> 12h time:
- The 24h time queried - 12 hours

To calculate 12h time --> 24h time:
- The 12h time queried + 12 hours

### DRT (Distance = Rate * Time)
e.g.
- 12km = 16km/hour
- 12km// 10km/h = 0.75h = 45 mins

### Tip
All months have 31 days except February, March, May, August, September, and November



## Lesson 2
### Working with Time
To calculate time on a calculator:
- Type the hour, then the [°'"'] button afterwards.
  e.g. 1° 45° 11°+ 2° 31° 1° = 4° 16' 12"
