# Welcome Back
We start off with Jih-wan tied to a rock with the ropes covering his torso. Unfortunately, the only way out is through an ally's help and I don't believe there's a way to get that unless he convinces his party members to release him. Only a few seconds remain before the Cinderbringer, Aldrig's father releases a thunderous strike that will disintegrate him into pure dust.

## Plans
- Introduction of [[Arcana Recalls]], so this campaign isn't too official on the rules now lol ;)
- Introduction of [[Improved Critical Hits]], which is way better than the usual critical hits, everyone will like this
- If no one helps Jih-wan, then two NPCs arrive that free him from his ropes and interrupt the wind-up spell attack
	- A ranger NPC (Tier 2, Heroes of The Realm) and fighter NPC help the team out
	- After around 3 rounds, the NPCs die from attacks from Cinderbringer
- The Cinderbringer is now on a rampage after the Soul Stabiliser Crystal has been bound to a shortsword
- It retreats away (allow opportunity attacks) and heads further into the Forelan Empire, and no visible trail can be seen
	- You can find a magical trail with the "Detect Magic" spell
	- Any tracking spells can be used to find Cinderbringer
- Orb reforms but has a glowing blue pulse every now and then, there are also multiple cracks within the orb making it unstable
- A disaster occurs in the Forelan Empire, in which the city is in chaos for how long the party takes
	- Many houses are on fire, the central area of the kingdom is on lockdown
	- Only authorised people are allowed in the central grounds
	- The king, Ash, a fire genasi with Lawful Neutral alignment, greets the party with great urgency
	- Sightings of the king before Aldrig have been seen recently, terrorising commoners and adventurers
	- Sightings of a red dragon have been flying through the Forelan Empire and contributing to the fires
