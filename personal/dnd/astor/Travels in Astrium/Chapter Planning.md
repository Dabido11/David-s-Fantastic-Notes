# Chapter Planning

## Chapter 4 "Something Unbearable"
When the party is now united and live on, their long rest is interrupted by poisonous green smoke and purple fire. Three dragons have arisen from the dead in the form of Poisonous Fire Dragons. When players fight these dragons, they take disadvantage of every roll (and have to roll three times and take the lowest number). 

When looking around, the council members all stabbed with swords, with one having a hole with fire still burning through their chest, which looks like Augustus.

For the simplicity of practical stats, players will fight three fire dragons and Augustus.

"The party all wakes up to a dazzling and shocking smell, the smell of fire and smoke can be sensed from miles away. As you all feel conscious, you all open your eyes and gaze at the numerous houses with poisonous green smoke and the putrid-smelling fire. You can hear screams and wailing from several commoners and the smell of potions and weapons being burned and vanishing into thin air. 'All of this was according to plan,' you hear, from a familiar voice. 

'All of your adventures have all fallen into my plan, the fall of Astor is now under my hands,' Augustus said, laughing, 'and there will be blood on my hands and I will be proud of my achievement.'

As Augustus reveals his true form, his disguise self spell vanishes, and Augustus appears to be the sorcerer that had been defeated, but how?

'Your part of my plan has now ended, and there is no use for you anymore, so you must be disposed of.' "

If players proceed to forfeit, Kanikuzul gets to use an Opportunity Attack with a homebrew "Soul Chain" spell which deals 3d12 + 4 if players fail on a STR Saving Throw. The only available exits out of Whiridge are the South and South-West exit. The North forest has burned down, the grasslands are completely gone and reduced to dirt.

***Players will be immediately in combat, with disadvantaged initiative, and have the option to forfeit. When players die after this chapter, they cannot be revived easily and the required spells are needed (any healing spells) to revive characters. If characters are not revived for 3 or more sessions, the character is deceased and cannot play as the same character again unless the spell [revivify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/revivify) is used within the first minute.***

## Chapter 5 "A Fallen Enemy, Reborn"
As the rest of the party are camping under the long-lasting blood moon, resources are getting very scarce.
