# The Essentials Collective (Homebrew)
Here is a set of homebrew rules you should definitely use. I use it in my campaign, Evermoor, so if there's any Evermoor people, this is the right place for you :)

These homebrew rules try to stay quite vanilla, but can derive a little bit far from vanilla. Use these rules carefully and wisely and tweak them to however you like.

## Inspiration Point Vote
At the end of the session, players can vote for the person who performed well. Additionally, if the DM is feeling nice, they will select an additional person of their choice.

## Hidden Death Saves
Death saves are hidden and only the DM can see it.

## Improved Critical Hits (ICH)
Improved Critical Hits is a system in which when you roll a critical hit, or Nat 20, you can roll for damage and your second roll is automatically the maximum the dice can roll. An example of this would be rolling a critical hit for your glaive, rolling 1d8, dealing 4 damage, and adding an 8 automatically to that roll (12). This makes it so that critical hits are guaranteed to be not lacklustre like rolling 2 ones for your damage.

Other than that, it also applies to monsters and players alike.

## Wounded, Bloodied, Mortal
When in combat or in general, you are to face many death threatening situations. You can tell the injuries and health of these particular monsters or creatures through these three statuses:
- Wounded -> The creature has not taken too much damage and is still at full force.
- Bloodied -> The creature is below half of its health, and many visible injuries can be seen from this point. (Passive Perception 12 is required)
- Mortal -> The creature has below 10% of its health, meaning many injuries and scars can be definitely seen. (Any Passive Perception)

## Proficient Help Action
The Help action allows you to give your ally advantage on any roll, including skill checks. However, we have tweaked it so that you must be proficient in the skill to use the Help action for your ally.

## Quick Draw
You can use a bonus action to use a potion or a weapon with the Thrown or Finesse property. When you attack with a weapon, you have Disadvantage due to a limited amount of time to draw your weapons.
