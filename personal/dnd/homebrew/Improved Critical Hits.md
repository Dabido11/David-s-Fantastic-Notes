# How does it work?
Improved Critical Hits is a system in which when you roll a critical hit, or Nat 20, you can roll for damage and your second roll is automatically the maximum the dice can roll. An example of this would be rolling a critical hit for your glaive, rolling 1d8, dealing 4 damage, and adding an 8 automatically to that roll (12). This makes it so that critical hits are guaranteed to be not lacklustre like rolling 2 ones for your damage.

Other than that, it also applies to monsters and players alike.
