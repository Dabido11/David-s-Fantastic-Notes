# Bloodied and Mortal
When in combat or in general, you are to face many death threatening situations. You can tell the injuries and health of these particular monsters or creatures through these three statuses:
- Wounded -> The creature has not taken too much damage and is still at full force.
- Bloodied -> The creature is below half of its health, and many visible injuries can be seen from this point. (Passive Perception 12 is required)
- Mortal -> The creature has below 10% of its health, meaning many injuries and scars can be definitely seen. (Any Passive Perception)
# Live or Die
The DM can announce if a creature is at one health. When a creature is at one health, it is at the brink of falling unconscious, falls prone, and has Exhaustion Level 5. The last person who dealt damage to the creature can choose whether to spare the creature or kill it. If it is spared, it falls unconscious through whichever means whether it is passing out or knocking them out. If it is killed, it automatically hits if the AC of the creature is below 15, if not, the person can attack the creature with advantage and deals a critical hit.
