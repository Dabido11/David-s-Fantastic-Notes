# Here's How It Works
## Quotes from Other DMs
"In order for a player character (PC) to gain benefits of a long rest, they must be in a safe place such as a village, town, city, or other fortified and protected area. They can't just simply sleep on the road and recover to full HP and half their hit dice. This puts a higher importance on Hit Dice resource management and gets them closer to the 6-8 encounters per long rest the original system was designed for."

"Heroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every moment in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest â€” time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure. While resting, a character can engage in limited activity. If they do more, their rest is interrupted, and they gain no benefit from the rest unless they start again. **Light activity** is reading, talking, eating, playing an instrument, tending to wounds, standing watch, or similar downtime activity. **Strenuous activity** is walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity."

## My Take on This New System
Long rests are a little broken, considering you can just recover all of your spell slots, HP, Hit Dice, and other miscellaneous actions. Here's a fix:
- Long rests cannot be taken when in an "unsafe" area, meaning there is no fortification and it can be considered unsafe as you can be ambushed quite easily
	- They cannot be taken in the morning hours, anything beyond the afternoon is acceptable for a long rest
	- You can only take one long rest per day
	- You only recover half of your expended Hit Dice on a long rest
	- You cannot take a long rest if you have already benefited from a long rest in the preceding 24-hour period. 
	- You cannot take a long rest if you have 0 hit points at the start of the long rest.
- Your HP also does not recover and you must instead use your Hit Dice + CON modifier for your health regeneration

Now, we've fixed long rests, let's also tweak Short Rests:
- A character can perform light activity when taking a short rest
- A character cannot perform strenuous activity when taking a short rest
