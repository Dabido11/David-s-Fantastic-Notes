# Welcome
Here are some session notes for the session at 29/5/2023.

## Pre-Session Notes
- Most notes and content here are from Marcus, thank you Marcus <3
- New quests should appear after fishing competition and detour to Shard of the Moon is complete
	- Shard of The Moon should be a library of knowledge and different artefacts should appear
		- If party decides to steal the artefacts, they should be of value within the range of 20-140 gp
		- If party decides to read the books and scrolls, inform them about the past of Neverwinter
		- If they roll a 20+ for Investigation, suggest that a wall seems odd and is outlined (might be a secret door)
			- Within the secret door, there should be a crystal that is worth 600-1800 gp (called the Moon Shard)
			- If the Moon Shard is stolen, the earth mote slowly collapses and everyone is alerted
			- It also produced 1d10 force damage on immediate impact or touch, and to avoid taking damage, the party must roll a DC 12 Constitution saving throw.
- Cloaked figure should inform them about the Hall of Justice and quest board
- Escort and attack/defence quests should appear in the Hall of Justice
	- Escort a potions merchants wagon through a dangerous trail full of possible bandits and other monsters alike
	- Reports of orc/goblin/whatever monster they can fight camps being constructed outside the city
* Performance quests should appear at a small gig in Neverwinter river
	* Music band is needed for performance
	* Sign should say at the area about a performance gig starting in 2 in-game days if a music band is found
- Baramin should sabotage the quests in revenge
- He should not appear until quests are accepted
- Baramin (possible) BBEG (?)
- Use bandits to help Baramin for sabotaging
- Baramin's motive: Only fight against Genghis, but be friendly towards the others
- If they decide to complete the quests successfully, the participating players are given gold in exchange for their effort and level up (only 1 quest)
