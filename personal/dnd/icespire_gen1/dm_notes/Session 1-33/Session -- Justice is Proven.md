# Welcome
Welcome to the session planning for June 7th, 2023.

## Pre-Session Notes
- After leaving the marsh, party heads to Neverwinter City
- The party receives their pay, 20 gp per party member
- When they leave Neverwinter, a storm of hail and ice spikes arrives just minutes after, dealing 1d4 damage to anyone within it except if they succeed a DEX save
- It becomes quite cold in Neverwinter, becoming uninhabitable
- Party must find a new base and must stop the source of the storm
