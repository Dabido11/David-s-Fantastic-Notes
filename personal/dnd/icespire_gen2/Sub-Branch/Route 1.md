# One Eyed Jack & Quiver of Avernus
Undisclosed date between 13 CT, Day 137 - 13 CT, Day 149

## Initiation (Scene 0)
Once everything has been setup, continue with this introduction.
> On one day in Mirabar, a mysterious duo with the names "Quiver of Avernus" and "One Eyed Jack" decide to look at the job board in the Hunters' Keep. The weather is quite cold today and it's been 9 long years of running and bounty hunting for a way to search for the cure and gain a side income at the same time. "A rogue powerful veteran fighter has been found near the Lurkwood and has been suspected of searching a once rumoured unknown but hidden city," it states on one of the parchments pinned to the quest bulletin.

> The leader of the Hunter's Keep consult you both at the Pedestal of Intiation. "Freelance bounty hunters of Mirabar, you will be bound by blood and soul to kill or capture this rogue veteran fighter. Once you have finished your quest, an owl will appear at dawn to send your rewards directly to you. Good luck, and by the Hunters' Keep you will honour us." The ritual markings below the three of you glow quite brightly, as a marking in the shape of a bear's growl now appears on your forearm. "Quiver of Avernus and One Eyed Jack, please seek out this fighter. It is a danger for all of us."

> After the initiation, you both head on to the Blackford Road and head towards the Triboar Trail. From there, you head east and travel within the Lurkwood. You were told on the quest to consult Sir Lupin Deepfrost within the hidden city after killing or capturing the fighter to inform that the bounty hunters of Mirabar are on their side. To find the city, you must travel through the forest and activate the five stones varying in shape, the stars, the sun, the moon, the earth, and the water.

## Pathway to Astrium, A Hidden City (Scene 1)
After the introduction is completed, let the players discuss for a minute. Then, head to the next blurb.
> You both stumble upon a path and are seeking this veteran fighter that is apparently a "danger to all of us". The sun is setting and it seems like a time to rest, what do you do?

### I'd like to rest
Flip a coin and tell the chosen party member to roll a d20. If the d20 is above 15, there will be no encounter for this night. Otherwise, initiate the ambush.

### I'd like to keep travelling
If the party continues to travel, initiate the ambush

## A Mysterious Ambush (Scene 1.1)
> As the sunset turns into the clear midnight, an ominous feeling rushes you all.

Inform the party to roll a perception check. Determine the outcome and conclude the result.

> As swift as light travelling, three bandits jump from the trees and land on the ground elegantly. They aim their crossbows at the two of you. A stronger bandit, one that looks like a leader, walks from the bushes and eyes you all. "I was informed there would be more... strong fighters that would hunt down our leader. This doesn't fit the description. Ah, well.. get them already!"
