## Major Plot Points
- The cure (Celestial Potion of Everlasting Flames) for the abyssal disease can only be created and a specific plant, magical item, grimoire, and divination magic to activate it
	- The plant, called Fruits of Virtue, can be found and grown in **Norland in the Moonshae Isles**
		- The Fruit of Virtue has similar appearances to a dragonfruit, except it has a golden tint and white particles around it
		- If the fruit is eaten, 1d6 max health is given but 2d12 of your current health is taken away if you fail a CON Save (DC 15)
		- The fruits are guarded by fae that will think whoever is grabbing the fruits are misusing them
	- The magical item, called Scrolls of Celestial Flames, can be found in **high-level dungeons or very established Wizards' Towers**
		- It is guarded by Clockwork creatures that will try to stop anyone from getting near it
		- The scroll can be used at will to create a circle of flames that is 5ft in diameter that will deal 3d12+6 to the selected target if they fail a DEX save (DC 15)
			- If they succeed, deal half of the damage that the target would've taken
			- Also, the spellcaster must take 1d12-(CON modifier) if the target succeeds
	- The grimoire, called The Tome of Secrets, can be found in the centre of the **four Wisdom Pillars located in The Grandfather Tree**
		- An aura full of malice covers the tree and the grimoire hovers on top of the tree, but a boss battle is initiated if it's touched
		- The grimoire contains 7 spells from the School of Necromancy, and is heavily damaged
		- It also contains the recipe for the Celestial Potion of Everlasting Flames
