# Renewal (Session 1)
## Context
When everything has been sorted, introduce the session by reading the text below.
> After the calamity (0 CT), everything went as normal and society lived on. However, on one unknown trip (4 CT) through the rediscovery of Wave Echo Cave, a rupture occurred causing many dwarven, elven, and human workers to fall deep into the cave. This spiralled into a butterfly effect in which there were multiple earthquakes in Phandalin, causing the actual village to fall down into the ground as well as the Dragon's Lair. Dark beams were shot in the bright daylight as it created pulses of energy that revived the dead commoners. A wave of what seemed to be abyssal undead ravaged through the land and tainted its blood on normal commoners to infect and increase their numbers.
> 
> The commoners who were informed and caught on to the infection quickly escaped through the gates in Neverwinter where the undead had not found them and rushed to nearby cities that were not infected yet. A city called Astrium was established in The Lurkwood, which is covered in invisibility barriers and sorts of magic that would make this city hidden. News spread and refugees of the late Neverwinter and Lionshields have discovered and travelled to Astrium.
> 
> Our adventurers today have lived on, but they are in a state of hiding. Will they prolong their stay in a hidden world or discover the lands beyond?

## Presence
(If no time, refer to [[Possible Plot Points]].)
Now we've gone through the context, what's going on now?

> At a lovely night in the Kingsworth Tavern, a celebration is hosted for the opening of this brand new tavern. All items are at a 80% discount, as well as services. Of course, to celebrate the tavern's opening, you have all gathered here to have a drink and feast! However, a strange roaring occurs outside and some commoners decided to check it out. An hour later, they have not returned since they left. Everyone has been wondering what has happened, but no one seems to know.
> 
> On the next morning, a search party job has been established by Sir Lupin Deepfrost for the reward of 20 gp to each person within the party. If they can find the whereabouts and search for the location of the missing commoners, they may receive this reward and any loot that is found may be kept. Looking for gold and out of kindness, all of you enlist in the search party and you all now find yourself in a wagon with a horse.

### Search for Disappearances
Let the characters introduce themselves on the wagon before you continue with the next encounter.

> The trip is quite nice and windy, until an arrow starts flying and hurling towards one of the two horses driving the wagon. An arrow, enlaced in blue fire hits its head and dissolves just after. The driver is startled and brings out their short sword to investigate where the arrow came from. Just a minute after, they let out a scream and they are nowhere to be found. A trail of footsteps on the slightly muddy dirt can be seen.

#### I'd like to investigate
If the players decide to investigate the footsteps and follow it, read the blurb below.

### Quest Board
To claim these quests, go to the Astrium S&J (Services & Jobs) Hall and look at the quest board. Quests are typically posted by guilds or fellow adventurers.

#### Lost Tomb of The Dragonslayer (Recommended for Level 6+)
Mysterious disappearances have occurred within Leilon, an ancient ruin in the Sword Coast. No one dares to enter this place due to it being a hotspot for monsters and abyssal creatures, but a powerful greatsword that was soon lost in a dungeon has been located in this ruin only months ago. There has been no record of any adventurers surviving the insides of the tomb, but scouts have gone through the exterior of the tomb to find some more intricate details.

*Aim.* To find an ancient greatsword locked within a tomb in the Leilon ruins.
*Reward.* 1000 gp for the submission of the greatsword, 100 gp for finding the greatsword.

#### Remnants of Evil (Recommended for Level 8+)
Although it has been 13 long years, the beacons of the late Sormin, The Necromancer, are still in operation and are too dangerous to deactivate without magic. Of course, normal adventurers have tried and that didn't turn out well. Due to the incident and quakes, most of the beacons have broken down naturally but one still remains. This beacon has been amplifying the abyssal infection from Wave Echo Cave, a long lost forge of magical items.

With the forge now being infected and run over by abyssal undead, it seems like magical items have become quite exotic in these times. Spellcasters have tried to search every way to find new magical items but most are cursed by spirits or tainted by abyssal powers.

*Aim.* To destroy the lost but operating beacon in the Cavity of Necrotic Phandalin.
*Reward.* 300 gp per person involved in the destruction, 20 gp per person initial reward for finding its location.

#### Errands (Side Quests, Any Level)
Commoners tend to ask adventurers to run errands for them since it would help them in their everyday life. Things such as transporting goods, fighting off thieves, and destroying nests of harmful creatures can be rewarded and commended for an easy **50 cp to 25 gp**. However, the more errands they accept and do, the harder the errands get, as well as the rewards.

There may be special errands that connect to each other but give a multiplied amount of gold. Shopkeepers and organisations may look for adventurers who can complete tasks quick, concise, and easily. Some errands may also be time-limited, meaning that taking too long to complete the quest may give them less rewards, while completing it early will give them more.
