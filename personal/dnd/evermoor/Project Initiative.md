# Project Initiative
Project: Initiative is an experimental device created by Seriam Hearthstone, a gnome artificer who resides in Exaton. He has discovered a technology and specific formula to create an infusion with a few materials to create a very, and I mean **VERY** experimental device. How does it work, you may ask?
