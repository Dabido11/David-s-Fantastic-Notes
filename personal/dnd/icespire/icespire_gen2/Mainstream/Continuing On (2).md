# Reconnaissance (Session 2)
## Returning Back to D&D
As per usual, set up the session and introduce the scene.

## Alchemy Detour
The party has taken a rest now, and a letter has been sent to one of the party members. It states:
> "Hello adventurers, please come to my shop at Highsun (noon) so I can give you information. I am aware your group has quite peculiar capabilities and potential and you are just the right people for the job. My shop is south of Kingsworth Tavern and east of the Longbarrow S&J Hall. It has an interesting decoration that is in the shape of a star and a sign that states 'Caspian's Alchemy Shop'. Don't tell Deepfrost about this letter, cheers!"
