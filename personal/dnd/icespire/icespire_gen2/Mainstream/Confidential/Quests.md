# Quest Board
To claim these quests, go to the Astrium S&J (Services & Jobs) Hall and look at the quest board. Quests are typically posted by guilds or fellow adventurers.

## Lost Tomb of The Dragonslayer (Recommended for Level 6+)
Mysterious disappearances have occurred within Leilon, an ancient ruin in the Sword Coast. No one dares to enter this place due to it being a hotspot for monsters and abyssal creatures, but a powerful greatsword that was soon lost in a dungeon has been located in this ruin only months ago. There has been no record of any adventurers surviving the insides of the tomb, but scouts have gone through the exterior of the tomb to find some more intricate details.

*Aim.* To find an ancient greatsword locked within a tomb in the Leilon ruins.
*Reward.* 1000 gp for the submission of the greatsword, 100 gp for finding the greatsword.

## Remnants of Evil (Recommended for Level 8+)
Although it has been 13 long years, the beacons of the late Sormin, The Necromancer, are still in operation and are too dangerous to deactivate without magic. Of course, normal adventurers have tried and that didn't turn out well. Due to the incident and quakes, most of the beacons have broken down naturally but one still remains. This beacon has been amplifying the abyssal infection from Wave Echo Cave, a long lost forge of magical items.

With the forge now being infected and run over by abyssal undead, it seems like magical items have become quite exotic in these times. Spellcasters have tried to search every way to find new magical items but most are cursed by spirits or tainted by abyssal powers.

*Aim.* To destroy the lost but operating beacon in the Cavity of Necrotic Phandalin.
*Reward.* 300 gp per person involved in the destruction, 20 gp per person initial reward for finding its location.

## Errands (Side Quests, Any Level)
Commoners tend to ask adventurers to run errands for them since it would help them in their everyday life. Things such as transporting goods, fighting off thieves, and destroying nests of harmful creatures can be rewarded and commended for an easy **50 cp to 25 gp**. However, the more errands they accept and do, the harder the errands get, as well as the rewards.

There may be special errands that connect to each other but give a multiplied amount of gold. Shopkeepers and organisations may look for adventurers who can complete tasks quick, concise, and easily. Some errands may also be time-limited, meaning that taking too long to complete the quest may give them less rewards, while completing it early will give them more.
