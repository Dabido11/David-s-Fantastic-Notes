# Renewal (Session 1)
## Context
When everything has been sorted, introduce the session by reading the text below.
> After the calamity (0 CT), everything went as normal and society lived on. However, on one unknown trip (4 CT) through the rediscovery of Wave Echo Cave, a rupture occurred causing many dwarven, elven, and human workers to fall deep into the cave. This spiralled into a butterfly effect in which there were multiple earthquakes in Phandalin, causing the village to fall down into the ground as well as the Dragon's Lair. Dark beams were shot in the bright daylight as it created pulses of energy that revived the dead commoners. A wave of what seemed to be abyssal undead ravaged through the land and tainted its blood on normal commoners to infect and increase their numbers.
> 
> The commoners who were informed and caught on to the infection quickly escaped through the gates in Neverwinter where the undead had not found them and rushed to nearby cities that were not affected. A town called Longbarrow was established in The Lurkwood, which is covered in magical invisibility barriers and sorts of magic that would make this city hidden. News spread and refugees of the late Neverwinter and members of the Lionshields have discovered and travelled to Longbarrow.
> 
> Unfortunately, some of our greatest adventurers did not survive. Many of the major Lionshield members did not survive the fall of Neverwinter and Phandalin. Most of the members of the saviors of the calamity of Sormin, an undead necromancer, had succumbed to the infection and became elite members of this abyssal army. Fortunately, many were able to flee such as Maven, Temuljin, and Yamatraz.

## Presence
(If no time, refer to [[Possible Plot Points]].)
Now we've gone through the context, what's going on now?

> At a lovely night in the Kingsworth Tavern, a celebration is hosted for the opening of this brand new tavern . All items are at a 80% discount, as well as services. Of course, to celebrate the tavern's opening, you have all gathered here to have a drink and feast! However, a strange roaring occurs outside and some commoners decided to check it out. An hour later, they have not returned since they left. Everyone has been wondering what has happened, but no one seems to know.
> 
> On the next morning, a search party job has been established by Sir Lupin Deepfrost for the reward of 20 gp to each person within the party. If they can find the whereabouts and search for the location of the missing commoners, they may receive this reward and any loot that is found may be kept. Looking for gold and out of kindness, all of you enlist in the search party and you all now find yourself in a wagon with a horse.

### Search for Disappearances
Let the characters introduce themselves on the wagon before you continue with the next encounter.

> The trip is quite nice and windy, until an arrow starts flying and hurling towards one of the two horses driving the wagon. An arrow, enlaced in blue fire hits its head and dissolves just after. The coachman is startled and brings out their short sword to investigate where the arrow came from. Just a minute after, they let out a scream and they are nowhere to be found. A trail of footsteps on the slightly muddy dirt can be seen.

#### I'd like to investigate the footstep trail
If the players decide to investigate the footsteps and follow it, read the blurb below.

> As you follow the footsteps of what you believe is the coachman, the trail ends at a dead human dwarven corpse. It seems to be rotting and an arrow with blue flames can be seen on his head. The arrow seems to be slowly dissolving and immediately turns the corpse into stone. Immediately, an arrow starts hurling towards one of your party members. Four goblins that seem to have a sort of slime-like, blue malice is covering their entire body and the malice on their torso resembles a breastplate.

Complete the combat encounter, then refer to the next few blurbs.

> You all valiantly defeat the goblins that have ambushed and attacked you, but one seems to retreat and decides to run away from the scene.

### Reporting Back to Sir Deepfrost
The party reports back to Sir Lupin Deepfrost.

> "I see, you were ambushed by goblins but they had looked odd. Yes, I have noticed those infiltrating our city and we were trying to resolve the problem but we have had a minor setback. The goblins have grown stronger and stronger every day, with weapons that seem to be getting upgraded further and further. Thank you for the information, and I will give you all a reward for this." He hands a pouch filled with (10 x Party Members) gp.

> "Please report to me if there are any more sightings of this goblin problem. It has been affecting our city for quite a while now. I will give you a task sooner or later so please come back when you receive a letter from a messenger. Have a lovely day." He states this and creates a door that transports them to outside of the Longbarrow S&J Hall.
