# Welcome
Welcome to the Development Pre-Sessions, where the DM plans the character development of NPCs and BBEGs and worldbuilding for Icespire.

## June 2nd, 2023
- Baramin is now confirmed to be **BBEG**
	- His hatred for Genghis has driven him insane for power, trying to find an easy way to defeat such thing
	- He makes a deal with The Fiend, bloodlust rushing through his veins
	- He will find any way to gather souls and blood to offer to the Fiend
	- Mercy is no longer an option for him, unless he can use the enemy or ally as an advantage for his hunt
- Possible NPC infiltrates the party as a spy for Baramin??
	- They wear an awfully suspicious ring with red shards floating within its vicinity
	- Fortunately, they are not cloaked
- The Young White Dragon returns to the party to finish their deal, an adequate supply of bird meat for peace
	- If the deal is not fulfilled within 2 in-game days of the dragon's return, it wreaks havoc on multiple cities and places
	- If the deal is fulfilled, the dragon is befriended and is no longer a problem for the party
- When violence has emerged within the party, the sky darkens and a spherical, 15ft fog covers the party's vicinity
	- If a party member is in the fog, they immediately collapse on the floor prone and paralysed (not death saves)
	- The party member who incited/initiated the violent fight will be targeted immediately by the Agraverte (refer to stat block)
- A spark of a soft, dark blue light shard emerges from Neverwinter city, and the moon shines bright and blue
	- If you gaze upon the moon for this evening, you regain 1d8+4 HP out of combat
