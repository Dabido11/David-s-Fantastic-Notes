# What's next?
After stopping the calamity of Neverwinter, the party has been awarded a house and 150 gp each as a reward. It's a nice place to stop, so what's next for our adventurers?

## Quests ðŸ“œ
### Awakening of An Ancient Dragon
The crackling energy and mysterious noises have awoken an ancient dragon that had been hibernating for thousands of centuries under a dragon burrow. An ancient seal has expired and released the dragon from its chains, able to wreak havoc on the Sword Coast. Rumours of random earthquakes in Starmetal Hills has also been a sign for the dragon's appearance.

It states on the quest board that finding the location of this temple will give 30 gp per person, and completing the castle will award an extra 120 gp per person.
### Remnants of Evil
After the recent events, beacons of the Necromancer's evil still operates but have decreased in power due to their death. Adventurers around the Sword Coast have created and duplicated maps of the locations of these beacons and can be claimed from the Town Hall.

Refer to [[The Eye of The Storm]] for the beacons' locations. Each beacon is a tower that has varying monsters and traps lurking. Destroying each beacon and reporting to the Mayor will award you 50 gp per beacon destroyed.
### Lost Tomb of The Dragonslayer
Mysterious disappearances have occurred within Leilon, an ancient ruin in the Sword Coast. No one dares to enter this place, but a greatsword that was soon lost in a dungeon has been located in this ruin. The Neverwinter Hall of Justice will award 250 gp for the location of the greatsword, and 1000 gp for the submission of it.
