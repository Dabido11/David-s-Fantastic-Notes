# What's next?
After stopping the calamity of Neverwinter, the party has been awarded a house and 150 gp each as a reward. It's a nice place to stop, so what's next for our adventurers?

## Awakening of An Ancient Dragon
The crackling energy and mysterious noises have awoken an ancient dragon that had been hibernating for thousands of centuries under a dragon burrow. An ancient seal has expired and released the dragon from its chains, able to wreak havoc on the Sword Coast. Rumours of a temple rising in Starmetal Hills has been going around and peaking other adventurers' curiosity.

It states on the quest board that finding the location of this temple will give 30 gp per person, and completing the castle will award an extra 120 gp per person.

## Remnants of Evil
After the recent events, beacons of the Necromancer's evil still operates but have decreased in power due to their death. Adventurers around the Sword Coast have created and duplicated maps of the locations of these beacons and can be claimed from the Town Hall.

Refer to [[The Eye of The Storm]] for the beacons' locations. Each beacon is a mini-dungeon with 1 floor with varying traps and monsters. Depends on which beacon it is. Destroying each beacon and reporting to the Mayor will award you 50 gp per beacon destroyed.

## Lost Tomb of The Dragonslayer
