# The Eye of the Storm
A rune-enchanted ice castle had formed and appeared within the eye of the storm, the centre of Neverwinter and is located on top of Neverwinter River, slowly freezing the river as long as it stays intact.

## Castle
Information about the castle, good luck ;)
### Castle Interior
The castle includes 3 floors, with 2 floors being above ground and the 1st floor being Ground Floor. The corridors, hallways, and walls are enlaced with traps and poison to scare or drive away adventurers from entering this castle. Adventurers have already explored and inspected the walls, knowing that the runes enchanted on the walls are the spells "Poison Spray" and "Enhance Ability (Bear's Endurance)".
### Ground or 1F
- Encounter level: **Trivial** "This should be easy."

### Roof
- Encounter level: **Deadly** "It would be a death wish to be here."
- Challenge rating: 2-12

#### Entrance
To halt the party from entering through the stairs, *the fog arrives once again.* This time, it does not kill the party immediately and blocks vision. When they have finally reached the roof, the fog clears up and it can be taken into two routes.

#### Phase 3A
- Upset that the party's side of the deal hasn't been fulfilled, the dragon returns at the roof of the castle
- He refuses to accept any deal with a DC of 15 for any future agreements
- The dragon will now try to kill the party at any cost

- The centrepiece, which is in the form of the statue of a necromancer, pulses lightly and has 3d8+8 health.
- When it reaches 3/4 of its health, the stone covering a necklace on the statue cracks and falls to the ground, revealing a crystal covered in gold, in the shape of a skull. At first glance, this item has no effect.
- When the centrepiece reaches half its health, a pulse of necrotic damage arises within a 5 ft sphere. On a failed CON 14 save, the target(s) must take 2d10+5 necrotic damage or half if succeeded.
- Destroying the statue will deactivate the mirror-like devices and melt the castle slowly, clearing up the blizzard at a slow pace

#### Phase 3B
- If all beacons have been reunited, the centrepiece will shine and emit 2d10 poison damage to anyone within a 5 ft cube.
- For the archmage, it will laugh and intimidate the party until it takes its first hit. When this happens, the archmage will attempt to use cantrips and taunting them as the party takes damage. When the archmage is finally taken to half health, it will now start to play seriously and use proper spells.
- The archmage is weak at this point, meaning it will only have around 9d8+9, which is half of its original maximum health.

- When the archmage reaches half health, Baramin and the Young White Dragon returns to the rooftop, aiding the party on one last stand
- Zombies and Shadows are spawned when this happens
- When the fight is finally over, the dragon dies from the fog entering its mouth and Baramin suffers through a coma

## Beacons
Throughout the Sword Coast, beacons of green, necrotic power form and shoot at the mirror-like devices located in the castle. When all 4 beacons have finally shot their beams at the mirror-like devices on the castle, Phase 3B initiates. The beacons first activate and shoot right into the sky, forming a small field of acid rain within a 10 ft cylinder (except Beacon 1 and 3). 

### Beacon 1 (Neverwinter)
This beacon is located on top of Castle Never, the first one activating in order and is the only one within the blizzard. A simple crystal powers this beacon, and is not protected by any monsters but is instead protected by the sheer cold.

### Beacon 2 (Phandalin)
This beacon is located in Phandalin, the second one activating in order. It forms as a tower and breaks the fountain, protected by cultists and shadows.

### Beacon 3 (Thundertree)
This beacon is located in Thundertree, the third one activating in order. It forms as another tower, spreading flowers that induce necrotic damage and can be plucked or removed using Bless or any divination spell.

### Beacon 4 (Tower of Storms)
This beacon is located in the Tower of Storms, the fourth one activating in order. The crystal powering this tower is overridden with the new necrotic touch affecting it. Destroying the layers of shadow and green crystal shards covering it purifies this tower.
