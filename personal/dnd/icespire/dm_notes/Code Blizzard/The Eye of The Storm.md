# The Eye of the Storm
A rune-enchanted ice castle had formed and appeared within the eye of the storm, the centre of Neverwinter and is located on top of Neverwinter River, slowly freezing the river as long as it stays intact.

## Castle
Information about the castle, good luck ;)
### Castle Interior
The castle includes 3 floors, with 2 floors being above ground and the 1st floor being Ground Floor. The corridors, hallways, and walls are enlaced with traps and poison to scare or drive away adventurers from entering this castle. Adventurers have already explored and inspected the walls, knowing that the runes enchanted on the walls are the spells "Poison Spray" and "Enhance Ability (Bear's Endurance)".
