# Welcome
Welcome to Phase 0 of 3 for the Freezing Undead event.

## Notes
- The blizzard is only held within the city, not outside
- The river is affected by Phase 1, so any water touched in Thundertree and Neverwinter Forest will have consequences

## Development (Current Status; Phase 0)
- In the afternoon, a blizzard arises with storms of hail wreaking havoc on the city on the commoners and adventurers. It had seemed to come out of nowhere, who knows where it came from?
- The temperature gets colder, but it's still at a habitable rate. Hopefully this won't get any worse.
- We've taken shelter in our homes and shops, but this constant state of hail won't get any better. I wonder if we'll be able to get out of our houses soon.

## Development (Planning) (Phase 1)
- Blizzard gets worse, with spikes of ice forming instead of hail, dealing 1d4 damage per failed DEX save and the outright environment turning into a thick, unbreathable fog (CON Save, failed will induce 1d8 damage per 5 ft movement)
- A mysterious castle of magical ice engraved with runes rises in the centre of the city, freezing the river and spreading it towards Thundertree and the rest of Neverwinter forest
- The river's water cannot be touched or digested as it will deal 1d4 cold damage to any creature that makes these actions

## Development (Planning) (Phase 2)
- The blizzard has reached the state that anyone who enters it will freeze and be incapacitated if they fail their CON save, otherwise they will take 1d4 cold damage on a success
- The Young White Dragon returns to Neverwinter in desperation to reach the party for help
	- If not provoked and asked properly, he explains that there have been mysterious beacons of green light and mist beaming into the sky
	- If provoked, the dragon leaves in shame and leaves immediately after the first attack
- If either of these actions have happened, one out of four beacons redirect and shoot light onto a mirror-like device that absorbs light and is mounted on top of the castle
	- If all beacons unite, the Blizzard turns green and releases acid rain and ??? arises
	- If they have not united within the past 7 in-game days, the blizzard halts and the castle of ice melts

## Development (Planning) (Phase 3A)
- If the beacons had been stopped, the blizzard ceases to exist and the last blue moon arises on the night of success
- Unless they had made their victory known, no rewards are given but level ups

## Development (Planning) (Phase 3B)
**SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT**
- An undead archmage arises from the dead in the apex of the magical ice castle, and a bright, green beam beams in the eye of the storm
- The blizzard is unhabitable unless a torch enchanted with a Cleric's or Paladin's power is used, which clears fog within a 5ft cube
- It has created a worse fog of sorts, with people without the torch suffering from suffocation and the freezing temperatures (CON save, 1d10, and half if fail)
