# Concept Rulebook for Spellcast
## Core Rules
- A player gets a virtual character, like in a digital arena
- Each player rolls a d20+2 for AC, 3d12 for HP, d8 for class, and d4 for the amount of spells they can have active.
	- If the d4 is 1, players can reroll for another chance. (only once)
	- If the d4 is 4, the player can receive a spellcasting modifier by rolling a d4
	- If the d20 or d12 is 4 or below, they have the option to reroll for the dice that was 4 or below. (only once)
	- The spells they can use also depends on how many spells they can have, so if you rolled a 3 on your d4, you're able to use level 3 spells
		- Players will be given Spellcards they can collect to increase their deck of known spells.
		- These spellcards can vary from necromancy, abjuration, alteration, illusion, and divination.
		- Any enchantment spellcard given will be overridden with an advantage for the next spell casted
- If the spells require saving throws, the opposing party can choose to Block or Disengage to avoid the attack which requires a d20 roll
	- If the opposing party decide not to do these actions, let the enemy roll a normal d20 without modifiers

## 2 Players (Wizards' Duels)
- Once both players are ready, they roll a d20 for initiative
	- If it is a Nat 20, players get to have two turns for the first round
	- If it is a Nat 1, players take 1d12 damage and decrease their active spell count by 1
- Whoever has the highest initiative can cast the first spell with advantage
- When one party has negative HP, the opposing party wins
