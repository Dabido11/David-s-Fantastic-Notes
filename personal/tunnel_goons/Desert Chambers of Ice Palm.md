# Desert Chambers of Ice Palm 

*For a long time the chambers were considered lost. Lately a gang of goblins rediscovered them, making them their center of operation.*
1. A large double door on the western wall of the large room.
2. A strongbox holds an eldritch bow.
3. A stone of charming on a pedestal.
4. A corpse of a bard, a spear nearby.
5. A rear entrance into the chambers.
6. A ranger. Would like to hire you for a job.
