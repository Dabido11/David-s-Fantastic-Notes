Satellite Boy is a movie that talks about and delves into indigenous culture. In the introduction, it shows a boy and a man travelling through the warm, plains of the land. They come across two buildings and the boy is intrigued, in where he reaches a telephone area. He picks up the phone and hangs it up, sitting in a chair. The man sits down on a chair as well and talks about the camps he had back then.

Through watching the movie more, we assume that the boy is looking for his mum. We can know that the man knows the boy's mum because he talks about hunting with her.
