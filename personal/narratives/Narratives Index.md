# Welcome!
Welcome to the Narratives section of my personal folder. In this folder, I write notes about whatever and just have fun.

## Meshos, The Series
[[MS-Index]]: Read the index of this digital narrative series.

[[BK1, Callum; Inked Out]], set during March 2021. Right after the recent events of Briar.
(The story for this book is quite messy in the pilot section. It fills some of the plot holes and Callum's backstory.)
[[BK2, Inverted; The Messenger]], set during April 2021.
(This is a **COMPLETE** rewrite of the Briar series. onwards)
[[BK3, Abaddon; Nocturnal]], set during April-June 2021.
[[BK4, Windsor; Radio's Out]], set during December 2021.
[[BK5, Jacob; Finding Purpose]], set during February 2022.
