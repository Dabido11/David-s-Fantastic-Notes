## Recap, What do we know?
**To recap all of the story so far, and to fill some plot holes up.. (from the events of Vampire Kingdom)**

Callum had some trouble in the bar, and caught a policeman named Monty's attention. As Monty attacked Callum and Callum acted in self-defence, Callum finally gave up. He had fallen down, but something felt fishy. The ink-like substance was pulled into the ground like nothing ever happened and a microscopic spore had entered Monty's body through inhaling it, and Callum had access to Monty's mind.

His rebirth was inevitable, but he wanted to mess with this human. He proceeded to torment Monty but he just shook it off. With enough torment, he broke Monty mentally and infected his mind, now producing an ink like body and the flesh from his once-human body was now gone.

Since he had not died in this situation, he was reborn with no consequences.

His 2nd adventure was a rough start, a plant-humanoid basically beat him up.

These adventures led him to creating his own reality, except he amplified it, now transforming a mansion into an ink mansion. Inverted's attention had been caught by this and as a result he went to Callum's borders (outside of his reality) to consult him.

After talking with his old friend Inverted, he sought out for advice from him and the angels from the Silver City.
