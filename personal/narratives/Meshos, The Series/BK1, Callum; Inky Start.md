## Prologue
"Sir, we are getting close to the perimeter of the Bermuda Triangle," a soldier said, communicating over radio.

Veteran soldiers in the war were forcefully kidnapped, tracked, and controlled by the threat of explosive, to complete a mission in the Bermuda Triangle. The breeze was cold, and the ship felt warm under the sun.

"Copy, Proceed upon further instruction. Stay in that spot," the radio replied.

Suddenly, a huge octopus tentacle, the tentacle being around 100m tall. It pulled the entire ship down into the water, including its passengers. The connections between the technologies the government had and the bases were disconnected and most of the solders went M.I.A. Suddenly, one of the soldiers had a dream. They were finally in their selected paradise and thought they were in heaven, but a spirit appeared in front of them.

This spirit had the appearance of a snake.

"I'd like to propose a deal," it said to one of the soldiers, "you rebirth what Bermuda had and you will stay in this paradise."

The soldier agreed to this deal and the snake had bit him. His flesh suddenly went crazy pale and fangs grew. In his mind, he was in his paradise. But in the real world, an island arose from the oceans. This island was not visible to anyone, not even the celestial beings.

A vampire kingdom was born, and that is the story of Briar's origins.

## Chapter 1, An Inky Start
On the streets of the local village, a mushroom emerged from its dark corners. The patterns on this little fungus was unique, with white spots and a matte black tone to it. As the bitter dark gave shade to the mushroom, it grew further and further. 

During its growth through the next year, mid-year it formed an ink-like puddle around it. As the mushroom grew to around 30cm tall, the ink rose up and formed a makeshift shell around it.
