# C O N C E P T 
Halle (ha-l) is a laid-back and calm traveller who takes small jobs for little cash and uses it for further exploration. Travelling the sea as free as he wants, and giving many tips to the sailors who he travels with to traverse the cold and vast oceans.

# A P P E A R A N C E
Looking upon him, his light brown eyes are to be seen immediately, and a brushed back-like hairstyle is definitely present upon first look. His height is around an average height, and nothing much to expect. It almost looks like your average sailor on a normal Thireann day.

Halle is an open-minded, calm and collected person. He usually listens more than he speaks and finds interest in meditation rather than warfare. For him, taking the world slowly and taking in the real beauty in nature and the world is the best life for him. Although sometimes reality hits him, he tries his best to go back to exploring the world around him.

Finding the perfect recipe for his small cookbook is something he really values, since he values everything and tries to stay to a goal of perfectionism, even if deep down he knows that nothing can be perfect.

Intelligence is a key aspect in his life, and intelligence is his way of life. Other than meditation and staying calm, he focuses a lot on literature and studies to calm his nerves.

Following a strict but once prestigious household, his family was always a busy and closely-tight family. Despite the culture of his household, he would always find a way to make time for himself to go on mini exploration hikes. His time being alone didn't give him the opportunity to seek out friends, and he didn't want to anyway. Sure, over the years he made some connections but most of them went away due to his quiet nature. He would always ignore and never talk to the people beside him, and would always cherish the world around him. The nature, the sky, the air. All of this had sparked his interest in magic, which he knew that he already unlock in him already.

Teaching himself the ways of magic, he used this advantage for his own needs but not his wants. He would never wreak havoc on the world and would give back anything he takes from nature, whether it uses his life force or not.

Once reality and responsibility hit him, he was forced to socialise with his peers. Always known as the quiet one, he would never engage in small talk with  other people and just get the job done. Talk, complete, reward was his routine. He used his spare change to go out and explore the seas beyond him and the woods near the busy docks.
