# C O N C E P T 
Halle (ha-l) is a laid-back and calm traveller who takes small jobs for little cash and uses it for further exploration. Travelling the sea as free as he wants, and giving many tips to the sailors who he travels with to traverse the cold and vast oceans.

# A P P E A R A N C E
Looking upon him, his light brown eyes are to be seen immediately, and a brushed back-like hairstyle is definitely present upon first look. His height is around an average height, and nothing much to expect. It almost looks like your average sailor on a normal Thireann day.

# P E R S O N A L I T Y

Halle is an open-minded, calm and collected person. He usually listens more than he speaks and finds interest in meditation rather than warfare. For him, taking the world slowly and taking in the real beauty in nature and the world is the best life for him. Although sometimes reality hits him, he tries his best to go back to exploring the world around him.

Finding the perfect recipe for his small cookbook is something he really values, since he values everything and tries to stay to a goal of perfectionism, even if deep down he knows that nothing can be perfect.

Intelligence is a key aspect in his life, and intelligence is his way of life. Other than meditation and staying calm, he focuses a lot on literature and studies to calm his nerves.
