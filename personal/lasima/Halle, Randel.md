Halle (ha-l) is a laid-back and calm traveller who takes small jobs for little cash and uses it for further exploration. Travelling the sea as free as he wants, and giving many tips to the sailors who he travels with to traverse the cold and vast oceans.

Looking upon him, his light brown eyes are to be seen immediately, and a brushed back-like, brown hairstyle is definitely present upon first look. His height is around your average 5”8, and nothing much to expect. A build quite muscular, but slim. The amount of sunlight he intakes from his expeditions has made his skin quite tanned.

You can usually see Halle in quite bold, sleeveless and short clothes and keeps them fresh for his journeys. (He usually wears a bright, cyan, cotton, sleeveless vest and a graphite-black, dark pair of shorts made out of breechcloth.) He certainly doesn’t mind the cold breeze of the sea.

Halle is an open-minded, calm and collected person. He usually listens more than he speaks and finds interest in meditation rather than warfare. For him, taking the world slowly and taking in the real beauty in nature and the world is the best life for him. Although sometimes reality hits him, he tries his best to go back to exploring the world around him even if it means doing some dirty work. He’ll do anything for exploration and research.

Finding the perfect recipe for his small cookbook is something he really values, since he values everything and tries to stay to a goal of perfectionism, even if deep down he knows that nothing can be perfect. Since perfectionism is his ultimate goal, he seems to ignore and avoid people who can’t do their job well.

Intelligence is a key aspect in his life, and intelligence is his way of life. Other than meditation and staying calm, he focuses a lot on literature and studies to calm his nerves.

The whistles of air and waves crashing in the distance were the sounds he first heard when he was born. Ever since childhood, he had been taught many common etiquettes and lessons. The household of the clan was often restrictive and firm with his teaching, and he would always be bored or upset whenever he had to go through those lessons of important information. Although he has been trained to respect people around him, he’s often yelled at when he makes even the slightest mistake.

# D E V E L O P M E N T  &  T E N S I O N

-   Character Development: Sometimes, he thinks to himself why no one is talking to him… But the thing is, he’s not reaching out to anyone. He realises that he’s become distant from the world as much as he’s gotten closer to it.
    
-   Personal Tension: He replays the same terrible moments he had in his childhood, and can’t hold it in himself when someone asks him about his childhood or parents. He tends to dismiss the fact that someone asked the question or would go into a mental breakdown.
    
-   Relationship Tensions: He tends to not socialise with the people in his clan and other clans, meaning he would seem like a foreigner or stranger if he talked to people, even if he’s been on the island for his entire life.
