# Uthal
The capital of the world. All leaders and council members hold meetings to provide justice and check in with the other nations of Astor. In most cases, convicts and criminals go into trial in this nation. This nation is also restricted from normal adventurers and commoners, as you need an invite with a magical seal to enter. It is also hidden from the naked eye.

The geography of Uthal is quite fascinating, as it is a floating island in the middle of the 4 other nations of Astor. Not much is known about this area.
